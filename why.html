                <p>My commitment to Human-Centered AI was shaped by moments where I saw how easily intelligent systems can influence human decision-making—sometimes quietly, subtly, and without users realizing it.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <h3 id="defining-moment">A Defining Moment</h3>
                    <p>One defining moment was a research session involving an autistic user, whom I refer to as Maria. She relied on predictable patterns to anchor herself when interacting with digital tools. Each time the AI-generated suggestion matched her expectations, she smiled with relief. But when the system deviated, she paused, unsure how to interpret the deviation. Over multiple interactions, I watched her gradually defer to the AI—not out of trust earned but out of cognitive fatigue and perceived system authority.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>It was a stunning realization: <strong>AI systems do not need to be dominant to displace human judgment; they only need to be confident in the presence of user uncertainty.</strong></p>

                <p>This moment crystallized the purpose behind my work: <em>to design and study AI systems that reinforce autonomy, preserve self-determination, and strengthen—not overshadow—human reasoning.</em></p>

                <h2 id="deeper-problem">The Deeper Problem I Want to Solve</h2>

                <p>Across my work in EdTech, I saw how opaque recommendations from AI systems can influence educational pathways, career trajectories, and personal identity. Students often accept AI-generated suggestions because they feel lost, overwhelmed, or intimidated by complex institutional processes. In these cases:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI becomes a silent decision-maker.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Users mistake confidence for correctness.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Human agency is gradually displaced.</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>I designed transparency mechanisms, adaptive explanations, and value-sensitive defaults—but realized that ethical UX is only the first step. What we lack in industry is:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rigorous, longitudinal measurement of autonomy</li>
                    <li>Models for evaluating trust drift</li>
                    <li>Methods for detecting over-reliance</li>
                    <li>Frameworks for supporting value alignment over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>My research aims to address this gap directly.</strong></p>

                <h2 id="purpose">My Purpose as a Researcher</h2>

                <p>I pursue Human-Centered AI research because I want intelligent systems to participate in human life in ways that uphold:</p>

                <p>My long-term goal is to help build theoretical frameworks, empirical methods, and design principles for AI systems that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate uncertainty responsibly</li>
                    <li>Adapt explanations to user cognition and cultural context</li>
                    <li>Avoid nudging users into predetermined choices</li>
                    <li>Preserve human decision authority</li>
                    <li>Align with evolving human values</li>
                    <li>Support learning, not dependency</li>
                    <li>Respect cognitive differences and vulnerabilities</li>
