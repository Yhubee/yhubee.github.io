                <p>My commitment to Human–Centered AI was shaped by moments where I saw how easily intelligent systems can influence human decision-making, sometimes quietly, subtly, and without users realizing it.</p>

                <p>It was a stunning realization: <strong>AI systems do not need to be dominant to displace human judgment; they only need to be confident in the presence of user uncertainty.</strong></p>

                <p>This moment crystallized the purpose behind my work: <em>to design and study AI systems that reinforce autonomy, preserve self-determination, and strengthen human reasoning rather than overshadow it.</em></p>

                <h2>The Deeper Problem I Want to Solve</h2>

                <p>Across my work in EdTech, I saw how opaque recommendations from AI systems can influence educational pathways, career trajectories, and personal identity. Students often accept AI-generated suggestions because they feel lost, overwhelmed, or intimidated by complex institutional processes. In these cases:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI becomes a silent decision-maker.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Users mistake confidence for correctness.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Human agency is gradually displaced.</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>I designed transparency mechanisms, adaptive explanations, and value-sensitive defaults, but realized that ethical UX is only the first step. What we lack in industry is:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>rigorous, longitudinal measurement of autonomy</li>
                    <li>models for evaluating trust drift</li>
                    <li>methods for detecting over-reliance</li>
                    <li>frameworks for supporting value alignment over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>My research aims to address this gap directly.</strong></p>

                <h2>My Purpose as a Researcher</h2>

                <p>I pursue Human–Centered AI research because I want intelligent systems to participate in human life in ways that uphold:</p>

                <div class="interests-grid">
                    <div class="interest-card">
                        <h4>Dignity</h4>
                        <p>Respecting the inherent worth of every user, regardless of their technical literacy or background.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="interest-card">
                        <h4>Agency</h4>

                    <div class="interest-card">

                <p class="mt-4">The communities I have taught and led, including girls in Abuja, secondary school learners in Benin City, youth across Nigeria, and vulnerable users in London, reinforce my belief that <strong>technology must adapt to the human being, not the other way around.</strong></p>

                <h2>Building the Future</h2>

                <p>My long-term goal is to help build theoretical frameworks, empirical methods, and design principles for AI systems that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>communicate uncertainty responsibly</li>
                    <li>adapt explanations to user cognition and cultural context</li>
                    <li>avoid nudging users into predetermined choices</li>
                    <li>preserve human decision authority</li>
                    <li>align with evolving human values</li>
                    <li>support learning, not dependency</li>
                    <li>respect cognitive differences and vulnerabilities</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>My Vision</h3>
                    <p>I want to contribute to a future where AI interactions strengthen personal judgment and confidence instead of diminishing them.</p>
