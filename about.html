                        <p class="lead-text">My work in Human–Centered AI is anchored in a simple but profound observation: <strong>intelligent systems shape human behavior in ways that often go unnoticed.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>This insight emerged during a usability session with a neurodivergent user, "Maria." She relied on consistency to feel anchored in digital systems. Over multiple interactions, I watched her gradually defer to the AI—not from earned trust, but from cognitive fatigue and perceived system authority.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <p>That moment revealed how AI's aura of certainty can quietly displace human judgment. If AI is going to participate in everyday decision-making, it must be designed to reinforce—not override—human agency.</p>

                <h2>Applied Work</h2>
                <p>As a Technical AI Product Manager at Jourhney, I build AI-driven learning and decision-support tools for global learners navigating complex academic, immigration, and career choices. I focus on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparent rationale and value-sensitive defaults</li>
                    <li>User-managed control boundaries</li>
                    <li>Adaptive explanation cues</li>
                    <li>Making system limitations visible</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This work taught me that ethical UX interventions are necessary but insufficient. What's missing: <strong>longitudinal methods for evaluating how AI design influences human autonomy over time.</strong></p>

                <h2>Education</h2>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>MSc, University of Roehampton — Distinction</h4>
                    <p>My dissertation redesigned a digital food pickup system, exploring how perceived time and interface transparency shape trust and fairness evaluations. Key insight: what users perceive as "fair" is constructed through digital cues rather than objective metrics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Product Management Certificate, King's College London</h4>
                    <p>Deepened technical fluency in Python, SQL, and data modeling. Capstone with Sky—a WCAG/Ofcom-aligned AI accessibility feature—revealed how inclusion, autonomy, and personalization must be approached as intertwined design considerations.</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <h2>Current Focus</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mental models of AI systems</strong> — especially under uncertainty</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive explanations and trust-calibrating interfaces</strong> — responding to user context and goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Longitudinal autonomy</strong> — how confidence and value alignment evolve over repeated interactions</li>
                </ol>

                <p>My goal: help build a future where intelligent systems enhance human capability, preserve dignity, and expand access to opportunity.</p>

                    <h4>Short Academic Bio</h4>
                    <p class="word-count">100 words</p>
                    <p>Ubong Eno Nkereuwem is a Human–Centered AI researcher and Technical AI Product Manager exploring how people build trust, form mental models, and maintain autonomy when interacting with intelligent systems. Her work examines AI-guided decision-making, transparency mechanisms, and adaptive explanations in complex sociotechnical environments. She brings experience designing ethical AI features at Jourhney and Sky, using mixed methods and sociotechnical analysis to study how AI systems can reinforce human judgment rather than displace it.</p>
