      <h3>Micro Bio (25 words)</h3>
      <p>Ubong Eno Nkereuwem researches Human–Centered AI, trust calibration, and sociotechnical systems. She studies how intelligent systems influence autonomy, decision-making, and opportunity access across educational and accessibility contexts.</p>

      <h3>Short Academic Bio (100 words)</h3>
      <p>Ubong Eno Nkereuwem is a Human–Centered AI researcher and Technical AI Product Manager exploring how people build trust, form mental models, and maintain autonomy when interacting with intelligent systems. Her work examines AI-guided decision-making, transparency mechanisms, and adaptive explanations in complex sociotechnical environments, particularly in education and accessibility. She brings experience designing ethical AI features, value-sensitive defaults, and explainability tools at Jourhney and Sky, supported by research in CSR dataset annotation and digital services. Using mixed methods and sociotechnical analysis, she studies how AI systems can reinforce human judgment rather than displace it.</p>

      <h3>Full Academic Bio (200 words)</h3>
      <p>Ubong Eno Nkereuwem is a researcher in Human–Centered AI whose work focuses on trust calibration, human autonomy, and sociotechnical systems. She studies how people interpret, rely on, and sometimes over-depend on intelligent systems, particularly in educational and accessibility contexts. Her interest in this problem emerged during applied research sessions where she observed vulnerable users gradually deferring to AI recommendations simply because the system presented itself as confident. This experience shaped her commitment to designing intelligent systems that reinforce user autonomy and support responsible decision-making.</p>
      <p>Her professional work as a Technical AI Product Manager spans AI-supported learning tools, adaptive guidance systems, transparency mechanisms, and ethical UX interventions. She brings technical fluency in Python, SQL, and data modeling, alongside experience in UX research and sociotechnical evaluation. Her academic foundation includes a Distinction MSc from the University of Roehampton and a Product Management Professional Certificate from King’s College London.</p>
      <p>Her research investigates adaptive explanations, mental model formation, and longitudinal autonomy in human–AI interaction. Ultimately, she aims to develop frameworks that ensure AI systems strengthen human reasoning, preserve dignity, and remain aligned with evolving human values across diverse contexts.</p>
