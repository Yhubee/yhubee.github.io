                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This dissertation examined how digital interfaces influence perceptions of fairness, time, and service credibility. The project involved designing a digital Fast-Track pickup experience for a food service environment where bottlenecks and unclear feedback loops lowered overall user satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>By pairing interface changes with operational cues, the work explored how perceived time, fairness, and trust are sociotechnically constructed.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>Research Problem</h2>
                    <p>Across many digital ordering systems, the biggest complaints relate not to actual time but perceived wait time. This perception is shaped by transparency, environmental cues, interface feedback, and trust in the digital-to-physical handoff.</p>
                    <p>I investigated how these variables interact and how design can reset expectations to feel more equitable.</p>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>What I Did</h2>
                    <h3>Collected mixed-method data</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Surveys captured quantitative satisfaction indicators</li>
                        <li>Interviews revealed qualitative expectations and psychological factors</li>
                        <li>Observational workflow mapping contextualized digital behaviors within physical service realities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Evaluated interface trust cues</h3>
                    <p>Findings showed that time visibility improved perceived fairness, ambiguous cues signaled incompetence, clear sequencing (order confirmed → preparing → ready) improved confidence, and a lack of queue transparency led to distrust even when service was fast.</p>

                    <h3>Designed a redesigned service blueprint</h3>
                    <p>The new blueprint provided prediction-based wait estimates, transparent service states, consistent feedback signage, and UX patterns inspired by reliability and clarity principles. The projected impact was a ~35 percent improvement in perceived wait time.</p>

                    <h2>Scholarly Contribution</h2>
                    <p>This project deepened my interest in sociotechnical fairness, digital representation of physical systems, psychological construction of time and waiting, and trust as a hybrid of interface cues and environmental signals. It served as my entry point into HCI research.</p>
