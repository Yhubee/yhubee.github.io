                <p>I am a researcher and practitioner focused on human-centered artificial intelligence, with interests
                    in how algorithmic systems shape human agency, trust, and decision-making. My work examines
                    interactive machine learning systems, particularly how transparency and interface design influence
                    how people interpret and act on model outputs over time.</p>

                <p>I hold a master’s degree in Global Business Management, where I conducted mixed-methods research to
                    redesign a high-demand service system and uncover hidden sources of user frustration.
                    Professionally, I have worked on accessibility-focused AI features in large-scale technology
                    environments, and I currently lead research and product development for user-controlled AI systems
                    at Jourhney.</p>
