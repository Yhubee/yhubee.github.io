                <p>I study how people understand, negotiate, and sometimes relinquish control to intelligent systems. My
                    work examines how AI can be designed to strengthen human autonomy, support transparent and
                    trustworthy decision-making, and reflect human values in contexts where cognitive load, uncertainty,
                    and vulnerability shape behavior.</p>

                <p>My research spans human–AI interaction, trust calibration, adaptive explanation design, and
                    sociotechnical systems, with a particular focus on education technology, accessibility, and global
                    learner ecosystems. I am interested in how mental models of AI form over time, how interface cues
                    shape reliance, and how design decisions influence user confidence and agency.</p>

                <p>Across industry and academic projects, I have worked on intelligent learning companions, AI-guided
                    advising systems, digital service experience research, media accessibility, CSR dataset annotation,
                    and ethical UX interventions for predictive recommendation systems. These experiences exposed me to
                    a recurring pattern:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    AI often behaves confidently even when its reasoning is opaque, and users, especially those
                    navigating uncertainty, may mistake confidence for correctness.
                </blockquote>

                <p>This motivated my commitment to building AI systems that are transparent, interpretable, and
                    psychologically supportive, particularly in high-stakes or cognitively demanding environments.</p>
