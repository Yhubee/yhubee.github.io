                <p>Teaching and community leadership are foundational to my work as an HCI and Human–Centered AI researcher. My commitment to ethical AI is deeply informed by the years I spent working with learners, youth, and underserved communities. These experiences grounded my understanding of how people actually navigate systems, where confidence breaks down, and how structural and digital inequities shape decision-making.</p>

                <p>My teaching and mentoring history spans formal instruction, youth development programs, and community engagement initiatives.</p>

                <h2>Teaching & Mentorship Experience</h2>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Mercy Corps – ENGINE Program (Education, Nigeria)</h3>
                    <div class="card-meta">
                        <strong>Role:</strong> Group Head, Literacy & Life Skills Instructor<br>
                        <strong>Focus:</strong> Empowerment, confidence-building, learning scaffolding
                    </div>
                    <p>As part of Mercy Corps' ENGINE programme, I trained more than 100 adolescent girls across literacy, numeracy, and life skills. My work involved:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>designing structured learning modules</li>
                        <li>facilitating small-group study sessions</li>
                        <li>identifying learners' confidence gaps</li>
                        <li>supporting self-efficacy and personal agency</li>
                        <li>helping participants navigate educational transitions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These learners often faced systemic and cultural barriers that shaped their engagement with information. Understanding how they interpreted guidance and how they built trust—both with people and with tools—was formative to my sensitivity to vulnerability in human–AI interaction.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>DLCF Learning Program – Benin City</h3>
                    <div class="card-meta">
                        <strong>Role:</strong> STS Teacher<br>
                        <strong>Focus:</strong> Collaborative learning, conceptual grounding, scaffolded instruction
                    </div>
                    <p>I taught secondary school students in a structured STS (Science, Technology, and Society) learning environment. I learned how learners form misconceptions, how they internalize explanations, and how teaching methods influence cognitive load and decision-making confidence.</p>
                    <p>This work connects directly to my research on explanation design, mental model development, and decision pathways.</p>

                        <strong>Focus:</strong> Youth empowerment, civic engagement, leadership development
                    </div>
                    <p>As Country Director, I oversee national programs focused on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>digital literacy</li>
                        <li>personal leadership development</li>
                        <li>civic responsibility</li>

                        <li>community-based mentorship models</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>My role involves coordinating volunteers, designing program structures, and facilitating community partnerships. This leadership experience strengthens my commitment to developing AI systems that serve real communities, not abstract use cases.</p>

                        <strong>Role:</strong> Volunteer<br>

                    </div>
                    <p>I participated in zero-waste initiatives, community gardening, and food distribution networks. These programs broadened my understanding of public-facing service ecosystems and how people interact with community-support infrastructure—experience that informs my research into human–AI collaboration in public contexts.</p>

                <p>Working with learners from different backgrounds taught me:</p>
