    <h1>Teaching, Mentoring, and Leadership</h1>
    <p>My teaching and mentoring history spans formal instruction, youth development programs, and community engagement initiatives. Working with learners from different backgrounds taught me that autonomy is fragile in the presence of authoritative systems and that explanation style deeply affects comprehension, confidence, and willingness to question.</p>
